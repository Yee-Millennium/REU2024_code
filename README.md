 This repository contains codes of REU 2024 with PI Prof. Hanbaek Lyu.

 ## File Description

 1. ***sampling.ipynb***: Designed for sampling subgraphs for SNDL problem. You will get a matrix consists of subgraphs after vectorization, and a feature vector. If you want to sample subgraphs to just get an adjancy matrix, refer to NNetwork package.
 2. ***NDL_tutorial.ipynb***: Tutorial of NDL methods, mainly including code demonstration of learning latent motifs, and network reconstruction.
 3. ***SMF_tutorial.ipynb***: Code demonstration of SMF algorithm.
 4. ***SNDL_tutorial.ipynb***: Code demonstration of process to solve a supervised network dictionary learning problem, to display the dictionary, and to predict similarity among networks.
 5. ***MNIST_test.ipynb***: Code test for multiclass functionality of BCD algorithm on MNIST dataset
